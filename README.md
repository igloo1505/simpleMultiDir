# simplyMultiDir
This is a short script to automate creating a folder with multiple sub-folders inside. This written for a mac, but all of it should work on a windows once git bash is installed, EXCEPT the line beggining with "OSA". Since this is a development program, it's probably a good idea to look it over anyways.

If you've never run a .command file before, select open with 'terminal' 


If it gives you an error that you don't have 'permission' to edit this, than run the following.
￼￼chmod u+x /path/to/file.command.   

That means 'Change Moderator' u or user/owner of file and x for 'make executable' and the last bit is the path to whereever you put the .command file.
